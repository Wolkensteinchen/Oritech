Item and Fluid pipes have a moderate transfer rate by default, which should be enough for most uses. However, if you need to transport
a lot of items or fluids very fast, a **pipe booster** block can be attached to a pipe. When it is powered, it will massively increase the operation
speed of the pipe behind it. Item pipes will extract a stack every tick, and fluid pipes will extract up to 40 buckets per tick.
