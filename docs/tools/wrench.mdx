### Description
The wrench is a tool which can be used to edit and break pipes. It is used to change the connection in each independent direction of pipe, as well as to break pipes.

### Usage
#### Toggling Pipe Connections
All pipes can either be disconnected or connected in a respective direction. To toggle a pipe connection,
you must right-click on the existing connection to disable it. To enable a connection, you must right-click the center of the pipe,
clicking the side respective to the direction you wish to enable.

#### Breaking Pipes
To break a pipe, you must shift+right-click the pipe while holding the wrench. The pipe will drop instantly as an item.
Alternatively, you can break the pipe using the wrench as if it were a pickaxe. The wrench has a higher mining speed when breaking pipes.
